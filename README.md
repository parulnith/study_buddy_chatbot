An interactive, kid-friendly study assistant chatbot built with Gradio and powered by Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model. Designed to help children under 12 with their studies, especially during exam season.

Inspired by the need for a focused learning tool during India's exam season (typically March), this application provides an engaging way for kids to ask study-related questions, get explanations, and stay organized.
